# This workflow updates the pull request description with an auto-generated section containing the categorised commit
# message headers of the commits since the release. The auto generated section is enveloped between two comments:
# "<!---START AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->" and "<!--- END AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->". Anything outside these in the
# description is left untouched. Auto-generated updates can be skipped for future commits if
# "<!--- SKIP AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->" is added to the pull request description.
